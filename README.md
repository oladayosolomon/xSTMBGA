# Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Weight-Freezing and Markov Blanket-Based Dimensionality Reduction.

This repository contains the complete, executable source code that can be used to reproduce all experiments reported in the manuscript.

**PlatEMO (MATLAB) Component**

All evolutionary optimization algorithms used in this work (both proposed methods and baseline methods) are implemented inside the ```PlatEMO/ ``` directory, following standard PlatEMO conventions. 



**Python (DRL Baselines and Hybrid ERL References)**

The python/ directory contains baseline implementations used exclusively for comparison with traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and hybrid Evolutionary–DRL methods.
It is not used to implement the proposed xSTMBGA framework itself.
