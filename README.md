# xSTMBGA
Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Weight-Freezing and Markov Blanket-Based Dimensionality Reduction

Requires Python 3.11  and the Causal Learner: A Toolbox for Causal Structure and Markov Blanket Learning for MB Learning (https://github.com/z-dragonl/Causal-Learner).<br />
Clone this repository and install the packages specified in requirements.txt <br />
```
git clone https://github.com/oladayosolomon/xSTMBGA/
cd sRLXBench
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For the reacher environment, you'll need to install pybullet-gym from https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym<br />
```
git clone https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym.git
cd pybullet-gym
pip install -e.
```
You should doanlod the casdual learner toolbox and add its path to Matlab<br />
