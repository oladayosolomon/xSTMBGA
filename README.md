#Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Weight-Freezing and Markov Blanket-Based Dimensionality Reduction.

This repository contains the complete, executable source code that can be used to reproduce all experiments reported in the manuscript.



Python (DRL Baselines and Hybrid ERL References)

The python/ directory contains baseline implementations used exclusively for comparison with traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and hybrid Evolutionary–DRL methods.
It is not used to implement the proposed xSTMBGA framework itself.
